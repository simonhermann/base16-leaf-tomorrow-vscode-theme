# Base16 **Leaf Tomorrow** Dark Theme for VSCode
Since Tomorrow felt too red to me, I replaced that color with a nice green.

Works great with markdown, since it displays **bold bold** and *italic in italics*.  
Based on *Base16 Tomorrow Dark+* Theme by Shurelia.  

Recommended fonts are Fira Code or Source Code Pro.  
As file icon theme I like "Seti", "Monokai Pro Icons" and "File icons"  

### Colors
green1: #8CB978  
green2: #275511 (only used for activityBar badges)
