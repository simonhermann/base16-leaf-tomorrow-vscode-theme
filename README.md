# Base16 **Leaf Tomorrow** Dark Theme for VSCode
‚òòÔ∏è Minus red, plus green = beauty! üëΩü•ëüîã  
Since *Tomorrow* just felt too red to me, I replaced that color with a nice green.
Out came a less red and more green version of Base16 Tomorrow Dark Theme with some modifications in secondary colors and improved settings for markdown.

Works great with markdown, since it displays **bold bold** and *italic in italics*.  
Based on *Base16 Tomorrow Dark+* Theme by Shurelia.  

Recommended fonts are Fira Code or Source Code Pro. For Markdown, [iA Writer Duospace](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Duospace) is amazing.  
Matching file icon themes are "Seti" or "File icons".
