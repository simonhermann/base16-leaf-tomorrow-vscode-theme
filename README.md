# Base16 **Leaf Tomorrow** Dark Theme for VSCode

‚òòÔ∏è Less red, more green + tons of small improvements üëΩü•ëüîã  
Since _Tomorrow_ just felt too red to me, I replaced that color with a nice green.
Out came a less red and more green version of Base16 Tomorrow Dark Theme with some modifications in secondary colors.
Now also optimised for writing distraction-free in markdown. It displays **bold bold** and _italic in italics_.

For Markdown, [iA Writer Duospace](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Duospace) is amazing.
